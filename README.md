# Random-Quote-Generator

In this project, you'll find an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. 

Used my growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops and object literals to:
  Locate and select quotes
  Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
  Write functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
  Change backgound-color
